They can filter down localities with parks close by, supermarkets to buy groceries and school for kids. Or if someone is looking to open a Japanese restaurant, he can look for a space which has malls close buy that will ensure enough footfall for the restaurant or compare the business of similar restaurants in the vicinity of the proposed area. The data collected will be first inspected, explored, processed and then modelled to provide solutions for the target audience. \n\n### Target Audience: \n\nAnyone who is interested in buying property in London. This could be a bachelor who has recently moved to London and wants to pruchase a home while he works in UK or an elderly couple who want to move to London to enjoy retirement. \n\n"
